<!-- Shane Ferrell -->

<h3>
	Hello! I am Shane Ferrell, a Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida. I have a passion for computer science and software engineering, and have loved learning at UCF. I hope to graduate, then go into the software engineering field.

	This website was made to serve two purposes. The first is for my self-education of web development, and the second is to show off random personal projects. Almost all of my experience has been in C and Java through school, but I hope to teach myself web development and other languages through these projects.
