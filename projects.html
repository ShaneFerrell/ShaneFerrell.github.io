	<h3>This Website</h3>
	<br>
	<h4>
		This website is where I began learning web development. I still have lots
		to learn, but I know basic html, css, and javascript (with jquery). I hope
		to improve this site, and learn more by doing so.

	<h3>Android Barcode Scanner App</h3>
	<br>
	<h4>
		I was approached to make an app for a company that would allow them to 
		scan barcodes, and track information through Google Sheets. Unfortunatly,
		the company decided to go with a more professional team, but I decided
		to turn this into a side project. I am learning more about Android development
		and Google APIs through this project, as well as cool Google mobile vision stuff.

		<br>
		<br>

		I still don't exactly know what it will turn out to be, but I'm working
		on it.  I'll update this if anything interesting becomes of it.

	<h3>Rock Paper Scissors Android App</h3>
	<br>
	<h4>
		This app is the first android app I made. I brought it back and decided to
		publish it to the play store. It is very basic right now, but I will continue
		to work on it and update it. 

		<br>

		Here it is on the play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.shaneferrell.rps
